# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Chrome Emacs respects your privacy and is committed to protecting any data that we may collect through your usage of our extension. This privacy policy document outlines how we handle and secure your data.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Collect

- **Text Data**: The primary data we collect includes text data from editable text areas and online code editors that you interact with using the extension.
- **Metadata**: We may also collect metadata related to these interactions, such as the URL of the page you are editing on, and basic interaction logs.

### How We Use Your Data

- **Editing and Synchronization**: The collected text data is transmitted between your browser and Emacs for the sole purpose of enabling bi-directional editing and synchronization.
- **Session Management**: Metadata is used to manage active editing sessions and to enhance the user experience by providing seamless integration.

## Data Transmission and Storage

- **Local Transmission**: All data transmission occurs locally and securely between your browser and Emacs. The extension does not transmit any data to external servers or third parties.
- **Temporary Storage**: Text data and metadata are temporarily stored in memory during active sessions and are discarded once the session ends.

## Data Security

We implement measures to secure the data transmitted between your browser and Emacs. These include:

- **Local Connections**: Data is transferred using locally established connections, ensuring that your data stays within your local network.
- **No External Servers**: Our extension does not transmit your data to any external servers. All interactions occur locally on your device.

## User Control

You have full control over your data through the extension's settings and Emacs integration. You can start and stop sessions at any time.
